# FooLime #

A plugin for both Sublime Text 2 and 3 that allows you to control foobar2000 from
the quick panel.

## Details ##

This one is more of a hobby project, just playing with Sublime and not really 
intended for general use. That being said however, if you do install it and find 
it useful please do let me know if you have any feature requests, comments etc :)

## Manual installation ##

At present the plugin is not in package control so you will need to install manually.

### Using GIT (recommended): ###
Go to the Packages directory (`Preferences` / `Browse Packages…`). Then clone this
repository:

    git clone git://github.com/CodeEffect/FooLime

### Manually: ###
Downoad a zip of the project (click on the zip icon further up the page) and extract
it into your packages directory (`Preferences` / `Browse Packages…`).
Go to the "Packages" directory (`Preferences` / `Browse Packages…`). Then clone this
repository:

## Default key bindings ##

`f5` - Open the quick panel and browse for files and folders
`shift+f5` - Control foobar: prev/next track, volume up/down, pause, quit
